  <h1> The Time is now to Fuck Shit Up </h1>

  <p> The time that we take to win at everything we do in life, is precious time we can use on something else in are ever changing life. These words are always there for people to hear, but do people actually listen to them? Many people want to be
    perfect, but this is not possible at all. You can always be the best you, you possible can be, but that is more than most things. Everyone will look at a certian person or people and say that they are much better than they are, but again that is
    not true. That person that is great at everything sucked at one point in their life. If you keep striving for more and more, you will get somewhere in life. And maybe just maybe you will end up somewhere you thought was never possible.
  </p>

  <p> I will always say things will get harder in life. I just always say that because for me that makes me think I have to bust my ass ten times more than I have already been doing. It is mind over matter, but it helps me with everything that
    happens. I may be an outliar, but I am the best fucking outliar I possibly can be.
  </p>

  <h2> The Truth is Always Harder to Hear </h2>

  <p> The truth will be anywhere you are, at work, at school, at home and honestly in space at some point. This is so crazy to think that fifty years ago we as a country were never on the moon and barely did the idea of being in outer space. And
    right now we are sending two inch cubes in space and they are do the same as some of the big satellites, that is crazy as shit. This is an odd way to start this section, but it is true and I gaurentee that people were laughing at the idea of
    something this small in space.
  </p>

  <p> The truth is hard to hear, but these people kept striving and now the truth is hard to hear. That this shit is actually happening and we will keep getting higher and higher technology. You may not beileve it, but as I said the truth is always
    harder to hear and understand than all of the lies in the world.
